/**
 * Exception thrown when user session operations fail or are invalid.
 * <p>
 * This exception is used throughout the MindHarbor application to indicate
 * problems with user session management, such as attempting to perform
 * operations when no user is logged in, trying to log in when a user is
 * already authenticated, or session-related validation failures.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Common scenarios that trigger this exception:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Attempting to access user-specific functionality without being logged in</li>
 *   <li>Trying to log in when a user session already exists</li>
 *   <li>Session validation failures during sensitive operations</li>
 *   <li>Concurrent session conflicts in multi-user scenarios</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This exception is typically caught by controllers and UI components to
 * provide appropriate user feedback and redirect to authentication screens
 * when necessary.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see it.uniroma2.mindharbor.session.SessionManager for session management
 * @see it.uniroma2.mindharbor.app_controller.LoginController for authentication handling
