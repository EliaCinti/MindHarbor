/**
 * Exception thrown when data access operations fail in the DAO layer.
 * <p>
 * This exception serves as a comprehensive wrapper for all database and
 * persistence-related errors in the MindHarbor application. It provides
 * a consistent way to handle failures across different persistence
 * mechanisms (CSV files and MySQL database) and DAO implementations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Common scenarios that trigger this exception:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Database connection failures or timeouts</li>
 *   <li>SQL syntax errors or constraint violations</li>
 *   <li>File I/O errors when working with CSV persistence</li>
 *   <li>Data validation failures during persistence operations</li>
 *   <li>Entity not found errors during retrieval operations</li>
 *   <li>Duplicate key violations during insertion operations</li>
 *   <li>Cross-persistence synchronization failures</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This exception supports both simple error messages and chained exceptions,
 * allowing the preservation of the original error context when wrapping
 * lower-level exceptions from JDBC, file I/O, or CSV parsing libraries.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see it.uniroma2.mindharbor.dao DAO interfaces and implementations
 * @see it.uniroma2.mindharbor.sync.CrossPersistenceSyncObserver for synchronization errors
 * @see it.uniroma2.mindharbor.patterns.facade.DaoFactoryFacade for DAO creation errors
