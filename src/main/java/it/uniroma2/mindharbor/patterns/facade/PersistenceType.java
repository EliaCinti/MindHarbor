 * Enumeration representing the available persistence mechanisms in MindHarbor.

 * between different storage types, allowing for flexible deployment scenarios.

 * <p>
 * Persistence characteristics:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>MYSQL</strong>: Full relational database with ACID properties, optimal for production</li>
 *   <li><strong>CSV</strong>: Simple file-based storage, ideal for development and testing</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The application can operate with either persistence type as primary, while
 * maintaining automatic synchronization with the secondary type through the
 * Observer pattern implementation.
